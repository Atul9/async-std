# Tutorial: Writing a chat

Nothing is as simple as a chat server, right? Not quite, chat servers
already expose you to all the fun of asynchronous programming: how
do you handle client connecting concurrently. How do handle them disconnecting?
How do your distribute the massages?

In this tutorial, we will show you how to write one in `async-std`.

You can also find the tutorial in [our repository](https://github.com/async-rs/a-chat).
